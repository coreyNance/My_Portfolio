          <p>This page is developed based on a feature testing app that I use locally on my computer.  I found it easier to test out functionalities to implement on a simpler application with just a few components instead of trying to do it on the bigger enterprise application.  When assigned tasks within the internship, I would first try to complete the task on the test application and then once I have it working as I intended, then I would try to implement it on the internshipâ€™s application.  This process helped me to isolate potential challenges and know if it has to do with my implementation or something within the application itself.  Now, this same set up is a great platform to showcase skills that I have learned by having this playground where users can check out the different features by interacting with the site.  </p>
