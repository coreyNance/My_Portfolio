# My Portfolio
 
## Description

This Portfolio is developed to display my information to prospective employers, recruiters, or clients. Through this application, the user can see various projects that I have worked in school, the bootcamp, and the current internship.  This portfolio can also display the different coding skills I learned as well as my coding style and practice.  




## Future Development

- Set up project links to not only click to repository but image can click to deployed site
    
- Set general project link to go to a more detailed description of all technologies used to complete the task.
    
- make it so that the drop down menu component is more re-useable to save code.
    
- Add database functionality either firebase, aws, or mongodb to pull project files instead of using a datasheet.

- add possible forms to fill out to request services or to set up contacts from potential employers. 

- add a more responsive mobile first design.

- add a component or page that interactive to showcase learned skills.
